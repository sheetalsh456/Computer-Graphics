Project Title : Attendance and feedback system of a class

We have taken multiple videos of the class while a lecture is going on. The faces of all students in the class are detected and matched with the faces stored in our database. They are recognized and then attendance is given. Also, their facial emotion recognition is done. After training and testing the data, we conclude the attendance of that day as well as the average facial expression of each student in the class. These expressions can be happy,sad,interested or sleepy. We also compare facial recognition systems using 3 different methods :
1. Eigen Faces
2. Fisher Faces
3. LBPH

Technologies used :
Python 
opencv
pyqt
